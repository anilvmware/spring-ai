# Tanzu Application Platform Demonstration: 

We recommend you use Chrome, Edge, or Firefox browsers in this workshop for the smoothest experience.

VMware Tanzu Application Platform is a modular, application development platform that provides a rich set of developer tools and a paved path to production to build and deploy software quickly and securely on any compliant public cloud or on-premises Kubernetes cluster.

Tanzu Application Platform delivers a superior developer experience for enterprises building and deploying cloud-native applications on Kubernetes. It enables application teams to get to production faster by automating source-to-production pipelines. 

Tanzu Application Platform includes elements that enable developers to quickly begin building and testing applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes.

Operations teams can create application scaffolding templates with built-in security and compliance guardrails, making those considerations mostly invisible to developers. Starting with the templates, developers turn source code into a container and get a URL to test their app in minutes.

After the container is built, it updates every time there’s a new code commit or dependency patch. And connecting to other applications and data, regardless of how they’re built or what kind of infrastructure they run on, has never been easier, thanks to an internal API management portal.

This workshop will give you an understanding of how operators will interact with the platform to enable iterative development cycles, and secure, automated delivery to production.
